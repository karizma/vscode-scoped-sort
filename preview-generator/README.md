# Preview Generator

This is the website source code where the previews are generated at.
Svelte might be overkill for a basic site like this but just wanted
easier scalability, plus it's just more fun.

## How to use

First install all the dependencies, with `npm i`. You might need to install more stuff for playwrite, but
it should tell you on the screen.

Next build the website with `npm run build`.

Next host the website with `npm run start`

Lastly run the program with `node main.js`
